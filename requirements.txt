CS 578 Assignment #2

1.	DES
i.	64 bits DES input and 56-bit key are given. Apply two rounds reduced DES and find the related ciphertext. You can find the related permutation tables and S-boxes from the lecture notes or DES Standardization document (shared on Canvas - DES-fips46-3.pdf).
ii.	Use the same DES key from part I and use the input below (only the red bit is different) and solve part I again. Compare the output differences from part i and part ii.
iii.	Use the same DES key from part I and use the input below (only the red bit is different) and solve part I again. Compare the output differences from part i, part ii and part iii.
2.	AES 
Compute the given steps below. You can use AES specification for more explanation. Show your work and present the results on a table to make it easy to follow.
i.	
a.	Convert the given 128-bit input to Hexadecimal form.
b.	Write the input in a state diagram (4 by 4 matrix). Hint: pay attention to the order when converting to a table.
c.	Apply SubBytes Step: use AES S-box to substitute the input.
d.	Apply ShiftRows Step.
e.	Apply Mixcolumns Step: use Irreducible polynomial 洧녞(洧논) = 洧논8 + 洧논4 + 洧논3 + 洧논 + 1. Hint: You can use shift and XOR approach explained in class if you do not want to use finite field arithmetic.
f.	Apply AddRoundKey Step: Generate and use round keys.
ii.	Solve part i with the following input and the same round key. Compare the output bits.
